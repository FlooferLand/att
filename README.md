# ATT - Automated Typing Tool

Does the same thing as it's name implies, automatically types whatever text file you give it.

Great if you wanna look like a hacker since the program can have a random delay after every letter or if you wanna troll someone by letting the script run overnight typing out the whole Bee Movie script.

Doesn't really have a reason to exist, just thought i would give myself a challenge by developing this.
Use my code however you may.

The documentation is in `README.py`.
